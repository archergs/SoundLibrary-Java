# SoundLibrary-Java
A Soundcloud download tool built with Java and JavaFX

## Install
#### SoundLibrary requires Java 21, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows).
To install SoundLibrary, either download a release from the Releases page. Alternatively, you can compile an installer yourself!
With Java installed, clone the repository. Then run the corresponding build script in the root of the repository. You should be left with
a working installer. Please note, Windows users may need to install the WiX toolkit to create an installer.
